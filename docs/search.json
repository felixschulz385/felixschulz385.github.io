    "text": "I am a first-year doctoral student in Health Economics at the University of Basel, Switzerland. My interests lie in data science and the economics of the environment and health.\nIn my role as a research assistant before starting my PhD, I worked on several exciting research projects. My bachelor’s thesis on the interdependency of electric vehicle ownership and the availability of charging infrastructure in Norway was published in Energy Policy (link). I also participated in a research project on the impact of an opening-and-testing experiment on health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting paper was published in PLOS ONE (link). During my master’s studies, I developed a deep interest in using machine learning to derive innovative insights that can shed light on complex economic and environmental phenomena."
