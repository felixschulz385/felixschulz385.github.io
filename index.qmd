## About Me

I am a final-year master's student in Data Science and Economics at the University of TÃ¼bingen, Germany. Throughout my academic journey I have been fortunate to work as a research assistant at several universities across Germany. My passion lies in environmental and development economics, where I seek to make meaningful contributions to address pressing global challenges.

As a research assistant, I have had the privilege of working on several inspiring research projects at different universities in Germany. My Bachelor dissertation on the interdependency of electric vehicle ownership and the availability of charging infrastructure in Norway was published in Energy Policy ([link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112660)). I have also participated in a research project on the impact of an opening-and-testing experiment on health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting paper was published in PLOS ONE ([link](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265207)).

During my ongoing Masters studies I have developed a deep interest in harnessing the power of machine learning to derive innovative insights and create novel datasets that can shed light on complex economic and environmental phenomena.
