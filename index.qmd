![](resources/Photo%20Felix%20Schulz.jpg){width=300}

I am a first-year doctoral student in Health Economics at the University of Basel, Switzerland. My interests lie in data science and the economics of the environment and health.

In my role as a research assistant before starting my PhD, I worked on several exciting research projects. My bachelor's thesis on the interdependency of electric vehicle ownership and the availability of charging infrastructure in Norway was published in *Energy Policy* ([link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112660)). I also participated in a research project on the impact of an opening-and-testing experiment on health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting paper was published in *PLOS ONE* ([link](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265207)). During my master's studies, I developed a deep interest in using machine learning to derive innovative insights that can shed light on complex economic and environmental phenomena.
